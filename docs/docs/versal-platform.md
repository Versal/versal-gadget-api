title: The Versal platform
---

Versal is a platform for creating online learning experiences. If a person knows something, wants to teach it, and is technically savvy enough to post on Wordpress or Facebook, theyâ€™ll be able to author a **course** and publish it on Versal.

A Versal course consists of **lessons**. Each lesson can contain many different types of content - from text, images, and videos, to rich interactive elements. In a Versal lesson, all these elements are implemented as single-page apps, called **gadgets**.

Some gadgets are very simple - for instance, just showing a paragraph of formatted text. Other gadgets may present interactive graphics or a quiz to the learner. Course authors can create rich interactive experiences for the learners by selecting gadgets specially adapted to the subject matter of the course.

The Versal platform makes it easy for course authors to use such gadgets in their courses, without need for any coding. The authors will simply assemble their lessons from the available gadgets by dragging and dropping them into a lesson within the Versal **course player**. The course player is an online authoring/learning environment where authors can edit their course content and learners can interact with courses.
