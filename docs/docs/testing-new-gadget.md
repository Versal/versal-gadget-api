The newly created gadget is fully operational. To test it, run `versal preview` in the gadget directory:

      $ cd my-gadget
      $ versal preview

Now open the url [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a Web browser. You will see a Versal course player, which provides an editing environment with an empty lesson and a gadget below.

![empty lesson](images/my-gadget-0.png "Empty lesson")

Double-click on the gadget to add it to the lesson. You should see your working gadget:

![lesson with gadget](images/my-gadget-1.png "Lesson with gadget")

The gadget shows a question and an answer. The course author can edit the question text. (You can click on the question text to start editing it, since you are the author of this "course".) The learner can enter an answer.
