Gadgets can be created by third-party gadget developers and published to the Versal platform. The Versal platform provides essential tools and utility libraries so that gadget developers can better focus on building interactive learning experiences.

Because gadgets are custom-programmed, there is no limit to what you can do as a gadget developer. You can use any JavaScript libraries and frameworks, communicate with any third-party Web servers, and access the Versal platform services for tasks such as image or video uploading or persisting learner's data.

Technically, a gadget can be any application that runs in a Web browser. A gadget's scope might be very small and focused and only useful for a narrow subject, or it can be widely applicable to any subject.

### Gadgets examples

* a set of flashcards

* an interactive simulation of the human heart

* a game that teaches how to program

* an interactive quiz or test

* a Google document embedded in a lesson

Lessons are structured as a vertical sequence of gadgets. When an author starts editing a course, each lesson is initially a blank canvas where gadgets can be added, configured, and rearranged.

Lessons can be divided into sections by placing a section header gadget into the lesson. Header gadgets also allow the player to generate a navigable table of contents for each lesson.
