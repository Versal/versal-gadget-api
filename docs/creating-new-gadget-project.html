<p>A gadget is a single-page app that lives inside an <code>iframe</code>. The <code>iframe</code> for each gadget will be created automatically by the Versal player whenever a lesson is loaded.</p>

<p>The gadget communicates with the course player via events sent over a <code>postMessage</code> based event bus.</p>

<ul>
  <li>get and set persistent gadget configuration data: the attributes (configured by the course author) and the learner state (for each learner)</li>
  <li>let the authors upload images and videos to the Versal platform</li>
  <li>use some standard visual features of the Versal course player (“empty gadget” and “gadget error” views, property sheets, and asset upload dialog)</li>
  <li>store question/answer data and perform scoring (for quizzes and other challenges)</li>
</ul>

<p>More details about the lifecycle of the gadget are found in the <strong>Reference guide</strong></p>

<p>It is recommended for gadget developers to use <code>player-api</code>, which is a convenience library that hides the need for <code>postMessage</code> and provides some other useful functions (see below).</p>
